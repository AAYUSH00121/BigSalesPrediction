# BigSalesPrediction
This project aims to predict sales for a retail company using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features such as product attributes, store attributes, and historical sales data, we aim to build a predictive model that can forecast future sales, helping the company to make data-driven decisions and optimize their inventory management.
